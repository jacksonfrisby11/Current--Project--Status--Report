This is my Project Status Report Page, within it I have a code folder, and a figures folder. The code folder contains "Data_Comparison.py" this is the current python file I am working on. The figures folder will show all figures that have been created throughout this project.

- Scatter plot between Study hours and Learning disabilities and the resulting exam scores for those with and without LDs.
- Box plot to show parents education levels; College, High School, and Postgrad and resulting exam scores for those with and without LDs.
- Box plot to show parents involvement levels; Low, Medium, High and resulting exam scores for those with and without LDs.
- Bar charts to show the distribution of each categorical features.
- Box plot to compare exam scores between those with an LD and those without an LD
- Correlational heatmap to visualize relationships between factors in the data set such as, exam scores, study hours, parental involvement, parental education, etc.

A T-Test was performed to compare exam performance between students with and without learning disabilities. The results showed a significant difference in exam scores, t(df) = -6.65, p < 0.001, indicating that students with learning disabilities scored significantly lower than their peers without learning disabilities.


The dataset is from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors/data and is the csv file attached to the repository.
