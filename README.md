This is my Project Status 2 Report "Data_Comparison.py", within it I have the code for 2 visualizations,

- Scatter plot between Study hours and Learning disabilities and the resulting exam scores for those with and without LDs.
- Box plot to show parents education levels; College, High School, and Postgrad and resulting exam scores for those with and without LDs
  The dataset is from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors/data and is the csv file attached to the repository.
